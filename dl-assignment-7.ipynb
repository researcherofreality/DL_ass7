    "* Try to follow the experimental settings in that paper, unless there is a reason to deviate.\n",
    "* If the paper is not clear on some details, make a reasonable choice yourself, and motivate that choice.\n",
    "* You will have 3 weeks to work on this assignment.\n",
    "* Be aware that this assignment will take more time than previous ones. It is ok if you do not completely finish it.\n",
    "* We will *not* be providing you with much code. You will have to implement many things yourself.\n",
    "* You may freely use code from earlier weeks, and from the d2l books. Please add a comment to reference the original source.\n",
    "* You may *not* use implementations of the paper you find online.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tips and hints**\n",
    "* It is allowed and recommended to use more than just this notebook. Make separate python files for a library of functions, and for training and analyses.\n",
    "* If you like working with jupyter notebooks: make a separate notebook for trying things out, and keep this one clean.\n",
    "* Use checkpoint files before and during training.\n",
    "* In the notebook only display and discuss these results.\n",
    "* You may add new cells to this notebook as needed.\n",
    "* While the task is to reproduce parts of a paper, the big picture is more important than the exact details.\n",
    "* It is allowed to discuss the assignment with other groups, but try not to spoil too much.\n",
    "* If you get stuck, contact the teachers via discord."
